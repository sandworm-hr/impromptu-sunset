# WordFlow

WordFlow is a text editor with accountability. Instead of just telling writers how many words they've written, it measures the consistency of their typing, and generates a score based on their output. It encourages writers to keep writing by sharing their consistency with other users in real-time, and it helps build good habits by analyzing and keeping track of day-to-day writing output.
